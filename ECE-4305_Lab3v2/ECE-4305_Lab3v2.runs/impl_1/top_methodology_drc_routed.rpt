2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on button_out_debounced relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch db_inst/FSM_sequential_state_next_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin db_inst/FSM_sequential_state_next_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch db_inst/FSM_sequential_state_next_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin db_inst/FSM_sequential_state_next_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch db_inst/FSM_sequential_state_next_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin db_inst/FSM_sequential_state_next_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 3 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
